After contemplating the new Apple Design Language, I've made for you—

✨ GlassTime™ — a brief web experience.

https://glasstime.vercel.app/

It's less LiquidGlass and more like the entrance to a fanciful bubble world. But will humans ever grow tired of seeing chromatic aberration? 

I don't think so.

So go ahead. Check out GlassTime and have a good time.™

It will be interesting to see how Apple handles the very serious accessibility issues in this next chapter.

✌️ Thanks for reading and have a great day.

Clearly,
Jonathan WebGL
